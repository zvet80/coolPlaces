# coolPlaces
Application in Mobile Applications for iOS course @ TelerikAcademy

### Main Idea
coolPlaces is an application for gathering nice places people encounter in their trips in the cities, mountains, on the beach. These are places where you can take really great and interesting pictures. The idea is to collect not so popular but places with nice view, or something interesting.

### Main functionality
- the user logs in and register to have access to the places
- on the main screen there is a gallery with highest rated places, latest added, and a button where the user can find what cool places are near them.
- there is an Add place view
- details view, where the users can also rate and comment on the place
- each place has name, description, location, picture
